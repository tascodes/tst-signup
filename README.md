# Introductory React Project

Hello TST! This is a sample sign-up page using create-vite-app, TypeScript, and React.

It takes a simple approach, engaging useState wherever possible since the UI state here is not likely to grow.

Please excuse my slightly sloppy CSS - I have left some defaults in place from the Vite react-ts template.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on this project or its implementation, and thank you for your consideration!
